This is the Motor module for ICT2104 team project.

In the MotorSourceCode folder, it contains the source code for the Motor Control module to run the motor with the following hardware:

    - MSP432
    - DC Motor
    - Motor Driver

Drag the entire folder into your code composer studio, compile and debug to get started with your MSP432.

Have fun! :)
